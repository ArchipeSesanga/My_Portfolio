        ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Archipe â€” a passionate full-stack developer based in South Africa. I build modern, responsive web
        apps using .NET, C#, and Flutter, with a focus on clean UI and performance.

        I love turning complex problems into elegant solutions and always aim to write code that's both maintainable and
        scalable. Whether it's a burger ordering system for students or a real estate listing app, I approach each
        project with curiosity and care.

        Beyond coding, I enjoy teaching guitar, exploring music theory, and helping others grow through learning. I'm
        currently open to new projects, collaborations, or freelance work â€” feel free to contact me.

        Letâ€™s build something amazing together.
